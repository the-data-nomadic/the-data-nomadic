      <h2>🌍 Data Nomadic Who?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Nomadic</strong> is what I call myself because I’m on a quest to explore everything the data world has to offer.<br/><br/>
        After almost 3 years as a Decision Support System Engineer, I’m diving into Data Engineering with fresh eyes and big curiosity.<br/>
        This repo is part of that journey experiments, errors, and lessons as they happen.<br/><br/>
        If you're curious, learning, or just passing by welcome aboard! 🔥

      <h2>🚀 Why This Challenge?</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my learning playground—where curiosity leads, and credentials follow. First milestone unlocked: 🏅 Data Engineer Associate Certificate from DataCamp.<br/><br/>
        Next up: I’m chasing the clouds—literally. My second goal is to pass <strong> the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) </strong>strong> certification and turn cloud architecture into a storybook           of strategy and swagger.<br/><br/>
        Because learning isn’t a punishment it’s a power move. ☁️💡📖
