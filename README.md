      <h2>🌍 Data Nomadic Who?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Nomadic</strong> is what I call myself because I’m on a quest to explore everything the data world has to offer.<br/><br/>
        After almost 3 years as a Decision Support System Engineer, I’m diving into Data Engineering with fresh eyes and big curiosity.<br/>
        This repo is part of that journey experiments, errors, and lessons as they happen.<br/><br/>
        If you're curious, learning, or just passing by welcome aboard! 🔥
